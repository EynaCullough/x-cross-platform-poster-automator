## How It Works

**Input or Trigger** — The user initiates a task (e.g., posting content, updating configurations) via a simple interface or command.

**Core Logic** — The automation bot processes tasks, prioritizes them, and distributes them across Android devices. It communicates with devices using UI Automator or Appium, ensuring seamless task execution.

**Output or Action** — Once tasks are completed, the tool generates logs, provides feedback, and updates the status of all involved devices.

**Other Functionalities** — Offers batch processing for simultaneous tasks, integrates with cloud services, and supports parallel execution.

**Safety Controls** — The system ensures task retries on failure, uses backoff strategies, and keeps track of device status to prevent overloading.
